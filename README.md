# GPU Identifier
GPU Identifier is a lightweight application for your Mac's menu bar that lets you easily see what GPU your dual-graphics equipped MacBook Pro is using.
This is helpful if you use applications that take advantage of the dedicated GPU when in use, like Sketch or iMovie, and can help you save battery life knowing that the more powerful GPU is in use if these applications are running in the background.
GPU Identifier is written entirely in Swift and does not collect or transmit any of your data.
GPU Identifier is available for free on the Mac App Store.
